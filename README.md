# Pendekin

Pendekin means "shorten" in Indonesian. It's a URL shortener written in Deno that utilises
its kv store API.

It supports customised URLs, and will generate a random one if none is provided.
It also gives you a QRCode that you can download.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
